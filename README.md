# Week 1 Homework - Code Refactor

## Description

The code for this website was provided as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp, with the task being to refactor the existing code for accessibility and clarity. The site serves as the landing page for a fictional marketing company called Horiseon. While working on this assignment, I learned about the importance of removing redundancies in code and making websites accessible.
